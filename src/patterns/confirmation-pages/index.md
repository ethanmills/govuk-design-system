Use this pattern to let users know they’ve completed a transaction.

Include a link to the [GOV.UK feedback page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-feedback-page) to allow users to tell you what they think of your transaction.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "confirmation-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "xl", loading: "eager"}) }}

## When to use this pattern

You should use a confirmation page at the end of a transaction.

## How it works

Confirmation pages reassure users that they have completed a transaction and helps them understand what to expect next.

Your confirmation page must include:

- a reference number, if there is one
- details of what happens next and when
- contact details for the service
- links to information or services that users are likely to need next
- a link to your [feedback page](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/get-feedback-page)
- a way for users to save a record of the transaction, for example, as a PDF

<strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--grey">WCAG 2.2</strong> Do not include links, buttons or other interactive elements in the green confirmation panel box, as the focus state will not have a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 with the panel’s background colour.

{{ example({group: "patterns", item: "confirmation-pages", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, titleSuffix: "second", size: "xl"}) }}

### Help users who bookmark the page

Some users will bookmark the confirmation page as a form of receipt. You should allow them to return to the page, whenever possible.

If you cannot, make sure your service responds in a helpful way when users return using a bookmarked link. For example, if people use your service to make an application you could provide links to information on:

- tracking an application
- starting a new application
- what to do or who to contact if they have a problem with their application

<strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--grey">WCAG 2.2</strong> You must also make sure not to prevent users from copying, saving or retrieving information found on the confirmation page. For example, users should be able to select and copy the text of a booking number. This is to comply with WCAG 2.2 success criterion [3.3.7 Redundant Entry](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html).

## Research on this pattern

[Read a blog post about users who bookmark confirmation pages](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/10/do-users-return-to-your-service-after-finishing/).

### Known gaps

Research is needed on the best way to confirm transactions that are part of a wider user task. For example, where you might need to emphasise next steps more than completion of that particular transaction.
